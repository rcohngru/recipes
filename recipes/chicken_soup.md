### Directions

2. Bring chicken stock to simmer in a large pot. Salt to taste.
3. Chop vegetables into preferred sizes. Add to stock and simmer for 15 minutes.
4. (Optional) If cooking rice directly into stock, add uncooked rice with vegetables.
5. Chop up chicken into preferred sizes. Once vegetables/rice are cooked, add chicken to pot. Simmer until chicken is warmed through.
