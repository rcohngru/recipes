### Ingredients
- Orange
- Meyer Lemon
- Garlic
- Soy Sauce
- Oil (preferably sesame, but any will do)
- Honey/Syrup
- Salt
- Pepper

### Directions
1. Mince or press garlic as finely as possible.
2. Combine all ingredients in a bowl to taste.
3. Marinade raw meat for a minimum of 30 minutes before cooking.

### Notes
- I particularly like this one for salmon.
- I like to add a bit of hot sauce or sriracha to this for a kick.
